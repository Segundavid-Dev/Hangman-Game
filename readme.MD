# Hangman Game

## Implementation :
This is a simple Hangman game using python programming language. I used this as a small project to boost my programming skills and understanding logic.
The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secrets words. The random module will provide this ability.

* The Game : A random word(A fruit ) is randomly piecked up from our collections and the players get a limited chance to win the game. 
when a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before the chances are over.
